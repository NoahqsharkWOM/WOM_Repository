- The Keefei do not have a custom general however, due to only having a T1 unit. That being said, you will still get a custom general for reclaiming their clanseat (I will leave it to you to discover who they are however as their identity is intended to be a surprise!) (Links)

- Tharbad/Athamor is now an advanced blacksmith location (Links) 
- The Tir Croicoill no longer supplies level four armour- it instead grants extra diplomats to reflect its nature as a diplomatic structure. Enedwaith can still get level four armour by building both a blacksmith and a Clanmoot Barracks in Tharbad/Athamor however (Links)

As a general it is now 4 units per faction accross the board of 3 T1 and 1 T2, but the units replenish faster than before and the units more specialized to the faction's focus (Dale is very archer heavy for example). All except Angmar include a T1 mounted unit.

22nd January

27th February
- Orthanc Sentries removed
- New unit: Dunland Crossbowmen. T2 medium crossbow unit recruited from the Level 3 Barracks. Though actually the weakest of the T2 crossbow units in the game they'll give Dunland some late game ranged power after losing access to the, now Enedwaith only, Foresters.
- Updated Enedwaith's 'Notable Units' on the faction select screen.

1st February

2nd February
- Unit UIs added for Dunland Crossbowmen
- Druedain Hunters unit size reduced, anti-mount bonus reduced, cost and upkeep increased.

18th February

13th March
- HE, WR and Lorien artillery crews now have colour coded textures
- fixed trait and ancillary trigger conditions that could cause a crash

15th March 
- Amended the Woodelves alliance script as follows:-
    - Acceptance:-
	    - Your nation merges with the other and you get their regions and generals (custom bodyguards from the merging nation are lost)
		- You get acces to 4 units from the other faction and these are added to your usual barracks/stables/archery range at the proper tier and now also have culture requirements
	- Rejection (can be done at the very beginning of the script but you will still be attacked by Mordor):-
	    - You can train your elite unit everywhere at a 75% culture requirement
		- You can build Yavanna's Garden, possibly the most useful building in game yet. It gives:-
		LOCAL ONLY:
		    - 10 Recruitment slots
			- 3 free upkeep slots (4 in practice, see below)
			- Upgrades roads to Highways in its location
			- Recruits Ents
		GLOBAL:
		    - All archers train with +2 experience (subject to the annoying retraining bug)
			- 0.5% elven culture spread in all cities as standard (0.75% in practice, see below)
			- Amplifies ALL religion boosts worldwide by 50%
			- 0.5% pop growth in all cities as standard
			- 1 extra free upkeep slot in all cities
			- 1 recrutiment slot in all cities as standard (this means that if you build this garden then every town or castle you claim can recruit straight away - you don't need a town hall)
(Yavanna's Garden can be built in Caras Galadhon, Amon Lanc and Thranduil's Hall and all of its bonuses are stackable. If you build all three Gardens then all of the global bonuses are tripled (except recrutiment slots))
- Note 1:- Yavanna's Garden has been purposefully made REALLY enticing because the merging option is so appealing that we really need a good reward for rejection. 
- Note 2:- Ents can be trained from Isengard regardless of the choice you make above. 

- Guilds now have MUCH higher requirements so they should be a lot rarer 
- Changed Dol Guldur's 'Last Stand' army to spawn when Dol Guldur is lost rather than being reduced to two regions
- Flame Wrangler now available at the same tier as the ballista and the AI will train it more now anyway (increased priority)
- Changed the Khand Refuge building UIs to fit a Nomadic theme
- Rotated the White Hand on the Isengard town centre flag
- Harad's troll men general now has champions instead of warriors
- One of Harad's 3 starting generals now has Serpent Bladesmen as his BG
- Three units with Boromir at game start have gold armour now to show off the nice late game armour. 
- Skin Changers now have a huge mass stat and can completley disrupt enemy formations and knock back the odd man or two 
- Sauron's bodyguard has been hugely buffed to be in line with fighting a godly Maiar and to put him closer to where he was before the change to an infantry unit
- Bilbo now has Dwarven Travellers instead of Bandobras archers as a bodyguard and accompanying unit. 
- Dislikes Gondor trait no longer mentions Númenor 
- Added the pacify dead factions script and checked it worked. It did (thank Aulë :P )
- Set up the 4 units in the Woodelves alliance as follows:-
    - From Lorien to the WR: Galadhrim Swordsmen, Galadhrim Guards, Lorien Scouts and Sentinels of Cerin Amroth
    - From WR to Lorien: Elvenkings Axeguard, Elvenkings Gateguard, Woodland Horse Archers and Maethyr i Thewair

19th March
- Woodelves nations now have ownership of each other's militia but they cannot train these units (or retrain them). 
- Legolas has Hin e Daur as his bodyguard again because it is just too cool not to do that. :P 
- Farmhand Pikemen can now only be trained by Bree and have a 25% Culture requirement
- Farmhand Pikemen re-worked: Now they function as "real" pikemen with the 'long_pike' trait and their stats have been adjusted to be similar to that of other T1 pikemen (though they are the weakest T1 pikemen in the game)
- Livestock Farming line now slightly less expensive and 1 turn quicker to build. Levels 2 and 3 now provide slightly more income

7th July 
- (Links) Elite units have now been removed from AI Enedwaith's auto-expansion armies, so they should no longer start with them at turn one

- (Links) Adjusted some culture requirements (For instance Southron Pikemen required 50 Dunedain culture, far far higher than Harad's requirement which is only 25- this was lowered to 30) 
- (Links) Edited certain pools so that more units can only be recruited from the 2nd tier of barracks (So building it in regions such as Enedwaith and the Anduin now has a tangible benefit)- generally speaking any unit with less than 50 culture required now comes from T1, any unit with 50 or greater culture required comes from T2 
- (Links) Updated Dunlending unit cards for both Dunland and the ND (Somehow Dunland was using old unit cards for certain units and Warband Sentries were updated for the RK's barrack system)
- (Links) Updated event text for the RK/Arnor script to explain the benefits of each path, and what you are unlock, both at the choice itself and in the final events 
- (Links) Reforming Arnor now only requires the House of Kings to be rebuilt 
- (Links) Increased the cost and construction time of the House of Kings
- (Links) Adjusted the descriptions of the Dunedain Barracks to explain they also allow the recruitment of local human militia and Gondorian troops, and removed the text that claimed their construction was limited in certain regions (This is no longer the case) 
- (Links) Revised and expanded the Aragorn RPG and Arnor/RK Script 
- (Links) New features include a fail-safe that triggers if Aragorn dies and places the player on the Arnor path (Even if they selected the RK path), so they are not locked out of rewards, most events past the RK/Arnor choice also now have slightly different variations depending on if the player picked Arnor/RK, and the Arnor Restored event changes depending on whether Aragorn is alive or not. The Army of the Dead event also teleports Aragon to the other side of the mountains and spawns the King of the Dead there too
- (Links) There are also new events after the player has picked Arnor or the RK, outlining Elrond's reaction to the decision and the elaborating on the requirements for the RK/Arnor- these events also explicitly direct the player to move Aragorn to Ost Sul 
- (Links) The Ost Sul event has been transformed from a weird plot exposition about the Army of the Dead with no clear reason for why Aragorn needed to be at Ost Sul in the first place into a meeting with Gandalf where he recounts the legends of the Army of the Dead to Aragorn. This event is also now required for Gandalf to join the ND (Unless Aragorn is dead in which case it is not required) 
- (Links) Sons of Numenor can now be recruited from Minas Tirth as well (Requiring the RK or Arnor) as per their unit description and so RK get a chance to use them without having to rebuild the House of Kings 

31st July 
- (Links) Fixed the Hobbit CSM bug for the Arnor route of the script. No longer will Hobbits turn into Boromir! As a result, Faramir has had to lose his unique CSM for the RK route (Instead he has the pre-RK ND general model, so he is still semi-unique and doesn't use the Gondorian model like most generals) 
- (Links) Set up the RK Anciliary Baracks so it now requires the turks_extra hidden resource and now can only be built in regions where it provides units (Aka you can't build it in regions where it doesn't provide a benefit)
- (Links) The Balchoth Tribesmen now come from the same regions as the other Rhun units from this barracks

1st August 
- (Links) Updated the UIs of the Gondorian Mason Halls to be less militaristic 
- (Links) Added a UI for the ND's Annuminas Guildhouse Mason Hall building 

2nd August 
- (Links) Implelemented the following changes from Fynn: 
- (Fynn) Added unit info cards for warg pack and unit+info for ent catapult (just used the ent one as I wasnt sure if its gonna be removed)
- (Fynn) Changed gatekeeper secondary animation to halberd
- (Fynn) Fixed silver surfers for rohirrim/rohirrim archers for a lot of factions and dunhird champions for gondor/da
- (Fynn) Fixed rebel unit card for lorien archers
- (Fynn) Fixed mordor not attacking in alliance script
- (Fynn) Added 5% law bonus to dorwinion and anduin barracks to make them in line with rest
- (Fynn) Edited the faction select map for gondor to remove a region they dont have
- (Fynn) Made sure the castle version of the men of east culture building also get removed when khand goes good (edited)

13th August: 
- (Links) Added the Faction Information script (By clicking on the mission button an event will pop with an overview of the mechanics and general lore of your faction) and UIs for Gondor, Dol Amroth, AA, Northen Dunedain, Mordor, Dunland, Rohan, Dale, Dorwinion, Anduin, Khand, Harad, Rhun 
- (Links) The Arnor restored event now mentions it unlocks the Sworn units
- (Links) The bug with Lurtz's tooltip displaying incorrectly for Dunland should now be fixed
- (Links) Moved Heorot into the Dunland BoH merc pool so it no longer gains costal mercs and there is an equal number of regions in the Enedwaith and Dunland merc pools
- (Links) Updated Gundabad's leader picture on the campaign selection page with a higher quality version
- (Links) Updated the unit card of rebel Variag Nobles
- (Links) Waystation now correctly retrains Woodland Wardens for Dale instead of Woodland Scouts
- (Links) Added text for Khand's Level 3 Horse Breeder's Guild

14th August 
- (Links) Added UIs for the Dwarven and Elven Waystations
- (Links) Added unique UIs for the Men of the East and the Orc Waystations (All Waystations should now have unique and complete UIs) 

15th August 
- (Links) Reworded the historic events for W. & E. Osgiliath being rebuilt so they are consistent with the other messages for Annuminas and Fornost 
- (Links) Updated the main menu faction descriptions to account for v5's changes 
- (Links) Gandalf will now spawn at Turn 40 or later for the ND (Presuming you've reached the needed stage in Aragon's RPG or he is dead) instead of Turn 55
- (Links) The Northern Dunedain are now called the Northern Dunedain again (The Dunedain of Arnor are dead! Long live the Northern Dunedain!) 
- (Links) Edited the Arnor faction icons so they have a nice green background instead of an ugly black one (The Arnorian campaign banner now also uses the ND symbol and colours to indicate continuity in terms of gameplay features such as Beacon of Hope)

16th August 
- (Links) Fixed the T3 ND Barracks allowing Cardolan and Arthedain units to be recruited outside their AoR 
- (Links) The AI now no longer loses the ability to recruit certain Arnorian units if they upgrade to T3 (And AI replenishment rates are now consistent instead of higher tiers of barracks proving lower replenishment rates for the AI's recruitment of Arnorian units)
- (Links) Added a fail-sure to ensure Gandalf spawns for the AI ND
- (Links) You can now recruit Bree militia in Metraith as the ND 
- (Links) Once Arnor is formed, the ND can recruit certain Bree units as follows: Greenway units from Roads & Highways in regions where the Greenway ran (Fornost, Bree, Mengalen, Metraith, Tharbad), Gatekeepers from the Prancing Pony in Bree, and Watchmen units from their 2nd and 3rd tier barracks in select Bree regions and those nearby (Bree, Ost Sul, Undertowers, Micheal Delving, Hobbiton, Longbottom, Mengalen, Fornost, Annuminas, Tirdhuin, Celoniach, Metraith, Tharbad)- these units can all be upgraded with visual Arnorian upgrades (Due to them being done for the Bree script) 
- (Links) Edited the campaign script so the historic event for Rhudaur joining Arnor/RK will only trigger once the RK/Arnor is formed, and edited the ND's faction info message and the 'Arnor is Restored' event so they mention the Bree units you unlock

18th August 
- (Links) Edited the Summit event for Lorien and the Woodland Realm so it now mentions there is an economic cost if you raise extra troops 
- (Links) Removed unused entries in the historic_events file for the Twins to avoid confusion (There were indivdual entries for each twin's return with no event text, only TDB so no acutal event text was removed- in the live build they return at the same time and this event has proper text) 
- (Links) Edited the High Elves' campaign description and intro so it talks about both Lindon and Imladris rather than only Lindon 

28th August: 
- (Links) ALL general abilities should now display their effects on the battlemap if you hover over them- the traits have been retained so you can also see their effects on the campaign map. Some descriptions of these abilities were revised to be clearer and correct false information 
- (Links) Updated the ND's Enedwaith BoH units- they now get the Mochini Ambaxtoi, Mordag Fishermen and Liadan Spearmen instead of just the Mordag Fishermen and Keefei Hunters (Both of which they now recruit also as militia through their barracks anyway)- this is to prevent overlap between the militia recruitment and BoH and to allow the BoH units to be somewhat useful
- (Links) Added custom portraits for Enedwaith's and Dunland's spawned generals

29th August 
- (Links) Moved the Enedwaith Mordag clan seat from Bhaille to Barad Vin; adjusted the building and the script references
- (Links) Fixed certain Enedwaith and Dunlending generals not having the Iron Fist battle ability- they now have it, as their trait claims 
- (Links) Enedwaith Cavalry sprites no longer look as if they stand on their horses and now use correct sprites

11th September
- (TED) Enabled the building of strongholds for Orc factions
- (TED) Added new campaign strategy models for Orc factions:
	- village, town, large town, city, large city, castle, stronghold
	
12th September
- (TED) Updated the Wildmen stronghold CSM by adding a bottom outer wall to help distinguish it from the previous tier

13th September
- (TED) Enabled the building of large cities for Harad

- (TED) Enabled the building of large cities and strongholds for Khand
- (TED) Added new capaign strategy models for Khand:
	- village, town, large town, city, large city, castle, stronghold
27th September
- (Links) Added new traits as follows: 
- (Links) Generals from Enedwaith and Anduin will now spawn with a trait representing their Clan or Tribal group respectively (Enedwaith generals will spawn belonging to an Enedwaith clan, generals spawning with the Liadan trait require the Liadan to be conquered)- these traits provide bonuses reflecting their cultural heritage and will be inherited by sons 
- (Links) Dunlending generals spawn either allied to the Frekkalingir, Dunhird or are unaligned. These traits are weaker, but if generals prove themselves by winning battles, there is a chance these traits will be upgraded to more powerful versions- each trait has three stages (Winning battles where the odds are especially against you have a higher chance for these traits to be promoted).  As these are ideological rather than cultural, they are not guaranteed to be inherited by sons. 
_ (Links) The above traits have also been added to scripted and starting generals as appropriate and Anduin's starting generals traits and ancillaries have been reshuffled so they make more sense and they now start with a Valesman general (Magor) who is no longer initially part of your family tree 
- (Links) Druedain, Dubshithe and Wulfguard traits have also been added for custom and scripted generals

29th September
- (Links) All factions in the game now have access to all city and castle tiers- either they begin with them unlocked, or can unlock them through scripts 
- (Links) Changed all instances of Dubhshíth to Dubhsìthe in response to feedback on their name
- (Links) Harad now unlocks Large Cities and Strongholds by completing their Unit the Clans script- their faction intro, info and script completion messages have been updated to reflect this 
- (Links) Khand no longer needs to side with Mordor to unlock Cities/Large Cities/Strongholds and has unrestricted settlement tiers. By picking the horde route, you got them from Turn 1 anyway, so it felt silly to lock them for the other routes. This will change when Khand is overhauled so don't get too used to it 
- (Links) Anduin, Enedwaith and Dunland now have access to the final tier of the market, and Enedwaith and Dunland now have access to the final tiers of the town hall, castle hall and farms, so these nations are consistent with the other human nations in the game
- (Links) Duinburg can now build a port

30th September
- (Links) Reverted the change to Javelin animations made on the 06/15/2022- all non dwarven or goblin foot skirmishes now no longer use running up javelin animations and instead use the old animations 
Developer's Note: I investigated the effectiveness of the new animation and found that it was actually mechanically less effective than the old animation, even with buffs to the range of javelin units, and required more micro. These two factors resulted in the new animation being an effective nerf to javelin units, despite its visual appeal. As we are relatively late in v5's development, retaining the animations would have likely required Enedwaith's roster and campaign to require significant rebalancing due to their reliance on these units (As well as the potential for more systematic rebalancing being required), and so with these concerns in mind, this change has been reverted. The v5 installer will feature the option to use these new animations instead of the old ones (With an included buff to the range of the units that use them), but it will not be the default option v5 has been tested with. We will explore using it as the default option post-v5 when we can give it the time and attention it needs.

- (Links) Updated Historical Battles so the game no longer displays two of them, and their description is correctly displayed

- (Links) Uploaded the following changes by Fynn:
- (Fynn) Added the RK Barracks to Metraith, Elegar, Rhubar, Varfest, Ost-in-Ery
- (Fynn) Removed the RK Barracks from Tharagrondost, Cirith Iaur
- (Fynn) Revised unit pools so regions correctly provide the units for the RK barracks they are intended to and there are no regions where you can build it that don't train units
- (Links) Bree's Journeymen have been reduced to 5 missile attack so they are now the worst human crossbow unit in the game and there is a three point difference between them and the Gatekeepers 
- (Links) Incorporated Augimund's typo fixes to the export_buildings file 
- (Links) Edited the faction overview messages to add clarity to some points and extra detail 
- (Links) The faction overviews in the green books have now been removed so they can return to their true purpose and the information is contained in one location, accessible regardless of if you own the region (Credits and thanks to Augimund for writing them- they were very helpful for writing the faction overview event messages) 
- (Links) AI Enedwaith now does not get their elites unlocked till Turn 65, and won't unlock recruitment of Liadan or Dubhsithe units till Turn 30 

15th October 
- (Links) Removed references in Rohan's opening message to Thengel being alive
- (Links) Added new points to Bree's and the ND's faction info messages explaining their Hobbit AoR units

16th October 
- (Links) The restored Crypts of the Barrow Downs now allow the Northern Dunedain to recruit Dunedain Steelbowmen as well (So Bree and the ND now get the same bonuses- it was odd that Bree alone got them from the Restored Crypts)
- (Links) Killing the Barrow Wight armies that spawn when a good nation holds Mengalen will now add 50 population to Mengalen each time you destroy one of those armies 
- (Links) Noted this bonus in the Barrow Downs description and added explainations of the Barrow Downs script to both Bree's and the ND's faction info messages

26th October 
- (Links) The ND and Bree now recruit Dunedain Steelbowmen from the Restored Crypts building at the same rate as a city barracks (Their recruitment rate has been increased from 0.2 -> 0.4). 

29th October 
(Links) Made the following changes to Anduin in order to help out their AI and standardise things a bit: 
- (Links) The T3 barracks are set to only require a town/castle- however, they also have a blacksmith as a requirement 
- (Links) Their muster grounds are added to all starting regions for the AI only, and the AI also gets starting armories in Maelthlburg and Fenholm
- (Links) The AI and the AI only is granted the ability to recruit the first tier of Eothed, Beorning and Woodmen units regardless of which barracks they build- however, they do get these bonus 'cheat' units at a slower rate than the units the barracks actually provides

1st November 
- (Links) Fixed Isengard being renamed to "Treegarth of" instead of "Treegarth of Orthanc"

2nd November 
- (Links) Bree's Gate Keepers now use the MTW2_Pike_Primary animation instead of the MTW2_Halberd_Secondary animation so they no longer crash the game when they enter melee (Credit to @Jojo00182 The Changer of Bytes for the fix)
- (Links) The Advanced Armoury has been removed from the game, alongside the associated triple upgrades (Bree, Dunland, Dorwinion, Gundabad Rohan and Dale retain their unique blacksmiths/armour sources) 
- (Links) Generally, this doesn't mean anything will change, but certain Rohan visual upgrades now require the Glittering Caves 
- (Links) Text has been added to each Faction Info message specifying what Armour Levels they have regular access to, and what they can unlock 
- (Links) Enedwaith now starts with the 3rd Tier Blacksmith locked- they unlock it at the end of their script. This is to reinforce their ununified and underdog nature at game start (And event text has been edited to reflect this)
- (Links) Enedwaith's Clamoot Barracks, and Bree's, Dorwinion's and Dale's unique blacksmith text has been amended so it no longer says it acts as an Advance Armourer

11th November 
 (Links) Uploaded the following changes from Pythax:

14th November 
- (Links) Added Pythax's resized Financial Overview UIs 

19th November 
- (Links) Rejoice, Dunland's Clan Hunters projectiles are no longer quiet! (This was fixed by changing their damage type from blunt to piercing so they are consistent with the other units that use the stone projectile- this does not mean they have become AP) 
- (Links) Dunland's Clan Huntes now also have custom aiming and firing sounds from Rome Total War
- (Links) The unnecessary units_info folder has been removed from the dropbox build 
- (Links) Erebor has been given unit and unit info cards for Orocarni Warriors 

21st November 
- (Links) Implemented Krekbel's ND visuals for virtually the entire ND roster BUT Arthedain Footmen, Sworn Infantry and Sworn Horsemen (This is a huge visual overhaul)- as part of this Dunedain Steelbowmen/Cavalry/Armsmen/Blademasters and the BG now have RK visuals. Furthermore, the Dunedain Cavarly/Armsmen/Blademasters old plate upgrade remains in the game as a visual exclusive to the Arnor route 
- (Links) Implemented Krekbel's new Aragorn and Halbarad campaign and battle models
- (Links) The ND now are locked to Armour Level 4 at the beginning of the game. Forming Arnor unlocks Level 5; forming the Reunited Kingdom unlocks Level 5 and 6 
- (Links) Level 5 armour has been renamed to Gondorian Plate for Gondor and Dol Amroth; Arnorian Plate for the ND, and Adûnaim Plate for the AA. Level 6 armour is now called Númenórean Plate for the ND and is unlocked if they form the RK 
- (Links) Edited the RK formation message to include a mention that it unlocks Númenórean Plate 
- (Links) The ND Barracks no longer grant double militia recruitment in Fennas Druin
- (Links) Dol Armoth can now recruit Osgililath Veterans as intended (They were set to be allowed to, but as they couldn't build the T2 Archery Range, they could not recruit them- to fix this, the Veterans have been added to the T1 Archery Range for Dol Amroth **only**)

22nd November 
- (Links) Added Krekbel's RK upgrades for the Grey Company and the Gondor Bodyguard 
- (Links) Implemented White's RK visuals for the Dunedain Armsmen/Blademasters/Cavarly into the BMDB (although these are not yet used ingame)

(Many thanks to Fynn for allowing us to use these battlemaps from his sub-mod)

9th December 
- (Links) Added missing traits to Enedwaith's special general who spawns when completing their script 
- (Links) Several tweaks to the EDU; Hasharri and Liadan units now have base armour of Level 2 and receive upgrades at Level 3; Arnor's Sworn units plate visual upgrade is now linked to Level 5 armour (Arnorian Plate); while the Glittering Caves still provides Level 4 armour for Rohan, they no longer require it for visual upgrades which now require Level 3 instead, due to how restricted Level 4 armour is for them, so you can have a much greatrt chance of actually seeing these visuals. Finally, the alterative Arnor visual upgrade for the ND BG is now linked to Level 5 Arnornian Plate as intended

12th December 
- (Links) Added a section explaining Mordor's Temple units to their faction overview

- Updated the EDB so the AI's recruitment of the Arthedain/Cardolan units also requires not event_counter arnor_restored 1 and not event_counter reunited_kingdom 1 (this is so these entries do not apply to the player and only apply to the AI who, of course will never restore Arnor or form the RK)
